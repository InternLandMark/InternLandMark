Welcome to the InternLandMark organization. InternLandMark is mainly developed by Shanghai AI Laboratory. We welcome contributions to our project in different forms.

## Release
- LandMark 1.0

  We propose the project LandMark, the groundbreaking large-scale 3D real-world city scene modeling and rendering system. The project is built upon [GridNeRF](https://city-super.github.io/gridnerf/) (CVPR23). Please refer to the [document page](https://internlandmark.github.io/LandMark_Documentation/) for more details.

- LandMark 2.0: 

  We adopt the [Scaffold-GS](https://github.com/city-super/Scaffold-GS) algorithm, which combines the high-performance rendering efficiency of 3D Gaussian Splatting with the flexibility and high quality of various classic NeRF representations.

  Based on Scaffold-GS, we have leveraged optimizations in both the system([LandMarkSystem](https://github.com/InternLandMark/InternLandMark/edit/main/README.md)) and operators([OptimizedDiffRasterization](https://github.com/InternLandMark/InternLandMark/edit/main/README.md)) to reduce the computational requirements for training and rendering by two orders of magnitude compared to the previous generation.

  We further expand the model's editable capabilities and have launched a public experiential project, called [CityEyes](https://github.com/InternLandMark/InternLandMark/edit/main/README.md).
