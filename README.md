Welcome to the InternLandMark homepage. InternLandMark is mainly developed by Shanghai AI Laboratory. We welcome contributions to our project in different forms.

We provide üî•[CityEyes](https://landmark.intern-ai.org.cn/archi-view/home)üî•, which is a public experiential project where everyone can freely travel and edit the city scenes provided within it.

## üöÄ Release

üî• LandMark 3.0 [[Doc](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/nfCJowiYT4mfHJoHSeLWZA)]

- [08/2024] We public the [LandMarkSystem](https://github.com/InternLandMark/LandMarkSystem), which is the first open-source system for large-scale scene reconstruction training and real-time rendering.

- [08/2024] We develop the [FlashGS](https://github.com/InternLandMark/FlashGS) to enable real-time 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based rendering especially for large-scale and high-resolution scenes.
 
‚≠ê LandMark 2.0 [[Doc](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/G596DS2JLcclDXmkgxnr6g)]

- [06/2024] We expand the model's editable capabilities and have launched a public experiential project, called [CityEyes](https://landmark.intern-ai.org.cn/archi-view/home), where everyone can freely travel and edit the city scenes.

- [03/2024] Inspired by the Level-of-Detail (LOD) techniques, we introduce [Octree-GS](https://city-super.github.io/octree-gs), featuring an LOD-structured 3D Gaussian approach supporting level-of-detail decomposition for scene representation that contributes to the large scenes rendering.

- [11/2023] We propose the [Scaffold-GS](https://city-super.github.io/scaffold-gs) (CVPR24, Highlight), which combines the high-performance rendering efficiency of 3D Gaussian Splatting with the flexibility and high quality of various classic NeRF representations.

üéâ LandMark 1.0 [[Doc](https://internlandmark.github.io/LandMark_Documentation/)]

- [01/2024] We release code about kernel optimization of dynamic fetching rendering in [LandMark](https://github.com/InternLandMark/LandMark).

- [11/2023] We release code about dynamic fetching rendering in [LandMark](https://github.com/InternLandMark/LandMark).

- [09/2023] We release code about hybrid parallel training with model parallel and DDP training in [LandMark](https://github.com/InternLandMark/LandMark).

- [09/2023] We build a large-scale, comprehensive, and high-quality synthetic dataset [MatrixCity](https://city-super.github.io/matrixcity/) (ICCV 2023) for city-scale neural rendering researches.

- [07/2023] We propose the project [LandMark](https://github.com/InternLandMark/LandMark), the groundbreaking large-scale 3D real-world city scene modeling and rendering system. The project is built upon [GridNeRF](https://city-super.github.io/gridnerf/) (CVPR23).
