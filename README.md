Welcome to the InternLandMark homepage. InternLandMark is mainly developed by Shanghai AI Laboratory. We welcome contributions to our project in different forms.

## Release
- LandMark 1.0

  We propose the project LandMark, the groundbreaking large-scale 3D real-world city scene modeling and rendering system. The project is built upon [GridNeRF](https://city-super.github.io/gridnerf/) (CVPR23). Please refer to the [document page](https://internlandmark.github.io/LandMark_Documentation/) for more details.

- LandMark 2.0:

  We build a large-scale, comprehensive, and high-quality synthetic dataset [MatrixCity](https://github.com/city-super/MatrixCity) (ICCV 2023) for city-scale neural rendering researches.

  We propose the [Scaffold-GS](https://github.com/city-super/Scaffold-GS) (CVPR24, Highlight), which combines the high-performance rendering efficiency of 3D Gaussian Splatting with the flexibility and high quality of various classic NeRF representations.

  Inspired by the Level-of-Detail (LOD) techniques, we introduce [Octree-GS](https://github.com/city-super/Octree-GS), featuring an LOD-structured 3D Gaussian approach supporting level-of-detail decomposition for scene representation that contributes to the large scenes rendering.

  Based on the algorithm mentioned above, we leverage optimizations in both the system([LandMarkSystem](https://github.com/InternLandMark/InternLandMark/edit/main/README.md)) and operators([Flash3dGS](https://github.com/InternLandMark/InternLandMark/edit/main/README.md)) to reduce the computational requirements for training and rendering by two orders of magnitude compared to the previous generation.

  We further expand the model's editable capabilities and have launched a public experiential project, called [CityEyes](https://github.com/InternLandMark/InternLandMark/edit/main/README.md).
